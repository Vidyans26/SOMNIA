# Roadmap (Focused Next Steps)

- On-device audio inference (TFLite) for privacy-preserving snore/apnea screening
- Robust audio pipeline (VAD, denoise) and streaming segmentation for long nights
- Improved wearable fusion (SpO2 desaturations, HRV time/frequency features)
- Pose-based breathing and supine detection heuristics to flag positional apnea
- Explainability: per-epoch insights, trend plots, and confidence scoring
- Deployment: containerized backend, simple cloud recipe, Secrets management
- Quality: end-to-end tests for API and data ingestion, perf profiling
- Clinical validation plan and partnerships; usability feedback loop
